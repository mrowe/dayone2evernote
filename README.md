# dayone2evernote

Read Day One entry files and write an Evernote export file.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/mrowe/dayone2evernote and run `lein jar`.

## Usage

`dayone2evernote` takes two arguments: a path to the directory
containing Day One entry files (e.g. ~/Dropbox/Apps/Day
One/Journal.dayone/entries) and the name of the file in which to store
the Evernote export-format file:

    $ java -jar dayone2evernote-0.1.0-standalone.jar ~/Dropbox/Apps/Day\ One/Journal.dayone/entries/ dayone-notes.enex


## Bugs

 * Note title is derived by pulling the first sentence from the first
   line of the Day One note content, truncating to 80 chars if
   necessary. This is pretty naive.
